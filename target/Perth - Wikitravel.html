</p><p>Perth sprawls along a flat coastal plain, centred along the Swan 
River and bounded by the Darling Scarp to the east and the Indian Ocean 
coastline in the west. Perth has a population of around 1.6 million 
(2009), making it the fourth largest city in Australia. The many 
uncrowded beaches along the Perth coastline define the lifestyle: Perth 
is laid-back, quiet and safe.

<p>The Perth region has been home to the indigenous Nyoongar people for at least the past 40,000 years.

</p><p>British settlers established a free settler colony in 1829 as 
part of the Swan River Colony. The settlement was given the name "Perth"
 after the city of <a href="https://wikitravel.org/en/Perth_(Scotland)" title="Perth (Scotland)">Perth</a>, <a href="https://wikitravel.org/en/Scotland" title="Scotland">Scotland</a>,
 the hometown of Sir George Murray, the British Colonial Secretary at 
that time. From 1850, an influx of convicts boosted the size of the 
colony and their labour helped shape the early architecture of the city.
 The discovery of gold in the 1890s triggered a boom which, with 
subsequent mineral discoveries, has been key to the city's economy. As 
capital of the state Western Australia, Perth joined the Commonwealth of
 Australia in 1901.

</p><p>Once a small, isolated city, the mining boom in Western Australia
 following the end of World War 2 has led to a high rate of migration to
 Perth, which allowed its population to overtake that of <a href="https://wikitravel.org/en/Adelaide" title="Adelaide">Adelaide</a>
 in the 1980's. While the actual mining takes places in distant, more 
remote parts of the state, much of the mining-related services sector is
 based in Perth. Today, Perth remains Australia's fastest growing city, 
and in recent years has transformed from a relatively laid back city to a
 fairly vibrant one. Due to the fact that Perth's population growth was 
relatively recent, it lacks the dense Victorian core of the eastern 
cities, but makes up for it with its own charm, particularly seen in the
 numerous parks and other green spaces within close proximity of the 
CBD.

</p>
<h3><span id="People">People</span><span><span>[</span><a href="https://wikitravel.org/wiki/en/index.php?title=Perth&amp;action=edit&amp;section=6" title="Edit section: People">edit</a><span>]</span></span></h3>
<p>Despite its isolation and relatively small population, Perth is a 
surprisingly culturally diverse city. Due to the high rate of migration 
to Perth, slightly less than half of Perth's residents were born outside
 Australia. Its proximity to Southeast Asia and Africa has led to an 
influx of migrants from countries such as Malaysia, South Africa and 
Thailand, and this is reflected in the diversity of cuisine available in
 Perth. If you wish to experience a cosmopolitan culture without the 
hustle and bustle of larger cities then Perth is worth visiting.

<h3><span id="Climate">Climate</span><span><span>[</span><a href="https://wikitravel.org/wiki/en/index.php?title=Perth&amp;action=edit&amp;section=7" title="Edit section: Climate">edit</a><span>]</span></span></h3>
<p>The City has a temperate Mediterranean type climate. Summers are hot 
and dry whilst winters are generally wet and mild. Summer temperatures 
average 30°C/86°F between November and April. Maximum temperatures 
during the height of summer can reach and sometimes exceed the 
40°C/104°F mark. Very hot days tend to have very low humidity making 
conditions more bearable. 
 
</p><p>In the Perth metropolitan area the summertime temperature rises 
rapidly during the morning, sometimes relieved in the afternoon when the
 "Fremantle Doctor" blows inland from the ocean to cool the city centre 
by up to 10°C. The doctor often runs out of puff before reaching suburbs
 further inland, leaving the foothills and beyond to swelter till after 
sunset. 
 
</p><p>Winter (Jun-Aug) temperatures are usually around 19°C. Minimum 
temperatures occasionally drop to near 0°C on clear nights. Though Perth
 goes through lengthy dry spells in Winter, when it does rain, it pours.
 Storms with strong winds occasionally hammer a Winter's night, but they
 generally cause no more destruction than a toppled tree or flattened 
fence.

<h3><span id="When_to_visit">When to visit</span><span><span>[</span><a href="https://wikitravel.org/wiki/en/index.php?title=Perth&amp;action=edit&amp;section=8" title="Edit section: When to visit">edit</a><span>]</span></span></h3>
<p>Spring (Sep-Nov) and Autumn (Mar-May) are ideal times in which to 
visit Perth.  Spring (particularly October / November periods) is 
perhaps the very best to see the sights as after a decent winter's 
rainfall, the famous wildflowers around Kings Park and the Avon Valley 
bloom splendidly. The metropolitan areas as well as the bushlands have 
many flowering species which often flower en-masse, so it is wise to 
purchase over-the-counter hayfever or antihistamines from a local 
chemist before making a trip to see them with minimal discomfort. 
Beach-goers from colder climes might find the summer months too harsh, 
usually reaching about 35°C and sometimes up to 45°C during the midday, 
so it is perhaps best to visit during March-April or October-November as
 well as taking a hat, sun-screen lotion and sunglasses. 
 
</p><p>The local inhabitants tend to holiday during the height of summer
 or winter, either to escape the climate, or to celebrate it. In winter 
Perth inhabitants often travel north to <a href="https://wikitravel.org/en/Broome" title="Broome">Broome</a> or <a href="https://wikitravel.org/en/Bali" title="Bali">Bali</a>
 for the warmth, or oppositely staying in small chalets in the southern 
country during the winter to enjoy the cool wet climate and seasonal 
foods.

</p><p>Although Western Australia has many <b>public holidays</b> they 
are unlikely to cause much inconvenience to your travels. Shops are 
still open, public transport still runs and the sky is still blue. The 
exception may be New Years' Day (Jan 1), Australia Day (26 Jan), Good 
Friday (10 Apr in 2020), Easter Monday (13 Apr in 2020), Labour Day 
(first Monday of March), Queen's Birthday (27 Sep) and Foundation Day 
(first Monday in June), Christmas Day (25 Dec) and Boxing Day (26 Dec). 
Most larger shops and shopping centres, pubs and restaurants are closed 
on these days but smaller convenience stores and some fast food chains 
keep their doors open. That said however, more and more stores are 
beginning to open on public holidays. Sunday trading came into existence
 in late 2012 and most shops have quickly adapted to opening on Sundays.

<p>All scheduled international and domestic flights arrive and depart from Perth Airport (<a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/IATA" title="wikipedia:IATA">IATA</a>: <b>PER</b>). Though all international and domestic services operate under the same <i>Perth Airport</i>
 banner, there are 4 terminals, with two located either side of the 
runway, or about 9km (15 minutes) by road. The airport is working 
towards full consolidation on the eastern side of the runway by the 
mid-late 2020s, however in the meantime passengers may need to transfer 
to the other precinct if connecting between Qantas or Jetstar flights 
and other airlines. 
 
</p><p>T3 and T4 are Qantas Group terminals, and are connected as part 
of the same building. All Qantas and Jetstar domestic flights depart and
 arrive here, as do Qantas's international services to/from London and 
Singapore (the only international flights Qantas operates from Perth)

</p><p>T1 is also one building, with all non-Qantas international 
flights (including Jetstar's international flights) and all Virgin 
Australia domestic flights (except some regional flights, which depart 
from T2). T2 is located next to T1 and hosts budget carriers and some 
regional flights.

<p>The city and major hotels can be easily accessed by taxi or 
commercial shuttle buses from all terminals. Courtesy phones are located
 inside the terminals (for the domestic terminal, the courtesy phone is 
surrounded by a large board advertising accommodation past the baggage 
conveyor belt as you leave the arrivals area). 
 
</p><p>For more than two people it is often cheaper and faster to take a
 taxi into the city (waiting time and drop off other passengers can make
 a shuttle bus service to the city very long). A taxi by meter to the 
city will cost approximately $40 from the international airport; the 
shuttle costs about $15 per person. It departs from T3 and T4. 
 
</p><p>Starting 1 November 2015, Transperth runs a limited stops express bus service number 380 servicing T1 and T2 (<a target="_blank" rel="nofollow noreferrer noopener" href="http://www.transperth.wa.gov.au/Service-Updates/Service-Update-Details/introducing-new-route-380-and-time-changes-to-routes-285-286-287-288-293-and-298-15345">click here for the announcement</a>).
 The number piggybacks on the Airbus A380 airliner in an attempt to make
 it easy to remember. The frequency is once every 30-60 minutes between 
4.25am to 11.25pm from the City (Elizabeth Quay bus stop) and 5.20am to 
1.20am from the Airport (each starting 1 hour later on weekends).  The 
service uses accessible buses with dedicated luggage racks.  Tickets are
 at standard public transport prices ($4.50 adults, $1.80 concession, 
cheaper using a Smartrider).

</p>
<h4><span id="T2">T2</span><span><span>[</span><a href="https://wikitravel.org/wiki/en/index.php?title=Perth&amp;action=edit&amp;section=13" title="Edit section: T2">edit</a><span>]</span></span></h4>
<p>Located next to the international terminal (T1) the newly opened T2 
has a cafe and convenience store located adjacent to the forecourt and 
check-in hall. Past security there is a pub, cafe, Subway outlet and 
newsagent/convenience store. 
 
</p><p>See T1 for public transport details.

<p>Transperth buses serve T3 and T4. Two bus routes, 37 and 40, service 
the airport. The 40 is much faster than the 37, but the routes are 
coordinated to maximise frequency (e.g. 37 at&nbsp;:00, 40 at&nbsp;:15, 
37 at&nbsp;:30, 40 at&nbsp;:45), so don't leave a 37 to wait for the 40,
 except in peak periods. Finally, a warning that only <i>some</i> 37s go
 to the airport: many terminate earlier. Check the display on the front 
of the bus to ensure you are on a full length service. The service cost 
$4.20 per adult, and cheaper for children. The bus drivers take cash and
 give change.

</p><p>Alternatively, use the shuttle bus, although this is much less frequent and more expensive, it is more direct.

</p><p>There are a couple of coffee shops and food outlets both before 
and after security, as well as basic shopping, books and souvenirs. If 
you have some time to kill in transfers, there are some cafes open 
during business hours in the surrounding industrial park.  Walk straight
 across the car park, or turn right and walk past the long term car park
 to the Flight Path Cafe in the Civil Aviation Authority building.

<p>A free transfer bus operates between T1/T2 and T3/T4 operates 24 
hours a day, seven days a week. Between 0600 and 2400 buses depart every
 20 minutes and the journey takes approximately 10 minutes. From 2400 to
 0600 buses depart every 30 minutes.  
  
</p><p>A taxi between the terminals will still cost at least $20.

</p><p>The Indian Pacific leaves from and arrives at the East Perth 
terminal, which connects with Perth's suburban rail network as well as 
the regional bus depot.  The city centre is just a 5 min train ride away
 from the terminal. If you are carrying baggage, it is probably best to 
jump into a taxi as many of the city's hotels and hostels are located up

hours Perth Station can get quite busy, though it is always very safe

<p>Transperth operates a passenger ferry across the Swan River from 
Elizabeth Quay Jetty, where it connects with the Blue CAT bus, running 
to <a href="https://wikitravel.org/en/Perth/Southern_Suburbs" title="Perth/Southern Suburbs">South Perth</a>
 (on the promenade at the foot Mends Street). Fares are the same as the 
equivalent bus journey, and SmartRider cards are accepted. Services run 
every 15 minutes in peak times, and every 30 minutes off-peak. From the 
Elizabeth Quay Jetty it is a short walk past the Elizabeth Quay Station 
to main shopping and business streets of the CBD, whilst the South Perth
 terminal is a short walk to the <a href="https://wikitravel.org/en/Perth/Southern_Suburbs" title="Perth/Southern Suburbs">Perth Zoo</a>.(<a target="_blank" rel="nofollow noreferrer noopener" href="http://www.transperth.wa.gov.au/timetablepdfs/Ferry%20Timetable%20300%2020140601.pdf">Timetable/map</a>)

<h4><span id="Fares">Fares</span><span><span>[</span><a href="https://wikitravel.org/wiki/en/index.php?title=Perth&amp;action=edit&amp;section=24" title="Edit section: Fares">edit</a><span>]</span></span></h4>
<p>The Transperth system is divided into 9 concentric zones, as well as 
the Free Transit Zone (city centre and surrounds). The Free Transit Zone
 on the trains is only available to SmartRider (transport card) holders,
 passengers without a card have to buy a ticket. Tickets and passes are 
valid on all buses and trains within a zone. Tickets are valid for two 
hours and can be used on your return trip.

</p><p>Zone 2 extends as far as Fremantle and for most visitors a two zone ticket will suffice. <b>Single trip, cash tickets</b> can be purchased from bus drivers or coin-operated ticket machines located at train stations. The more convenient <b>SmartRider</b> cards automatically calculate your fare and deduct it from your card when you <i>tag on and off</i>
 upon boarding and alighting bus and train services. SmartRiders can be 
bought or recharged at Transperth InfoCentres, major train and bus 
stations and/or from most Newsagents. Bus drivers can also charge your 
SmartRider for you, however they will not provide change. SmartRider 
cards carry a 10% discount over cash fares.

</p><p>There are $12.60 DayRider tickets available after 9am during the 
week and anytime on weekends. FamilyRider tickets also cost $12.60 and 
allow two standard fare passengers plus up to five concession passengers
 unlimited travel - these are only available after 6pm Monday to 
Thursday, after 3pm on Fridays, and from 9am on weekends and school or 
public holidays.  This is an excellent value for couples and couples 
with children, as a standard one-way fare alone runs from $2.80 for one 
zone, $4.20 for two zones, and $5.10 for three zones.

</p><p>With the advent of the new SmartRider system, those passengers 
not holding SmartRider cards will need to present their paper ticket to 
the transit guard upon entering and leaving Perth and Elizabeth Quay 
Stations and selected suburban stations.

<h3><span id="Taxi">Taxi</span><span><span>[</span><a href="https://wikitravel.org/wiki/en/index.php?title=Perth&amp;action=edit&amp;section=25" title="Edit section: Taxi">edit</a><span>]</span></span></h3>
<p>Taxi experiences in Perth can range from hassle-free to problematic. 
Extended waits during peak periods (5AM-9AM Weekdays and Weekend 
Evenings) are common, but outside these times, taxis are plentiful. 
Booking a taxi is possible but only recommended if your journey is 
likely to be upwards of $25 or you are travelling to the airport. This 
is due to the convoluted way in which the dispatch services handle timed
 bookings. If your journey is likely to be short, it is better to simply
 call for a taxi once you are ready to leave, or hail a taxi if you are 
in a busy area.

</p><p>Two major taxi companies are <b>Swan Taxis</b> (13 13 30), who dispatch Swan, TriColor, 13CABS, Yellow and Coastal taxis, and <b>Black and White Taxis</b> (131 008). Apart from these two companies, there is another company called <b>Maxi Taxi Perth</b>
 (0406 553 313) who is providing excellent service to people of Perth. 
They are specialized in Maxi Taxis, airport transfers and they also have
 wheelchair taxis too. Which means a van with a hoist wheel chair ramp 
can pick up any disable people especially even if they are on electric 
wheel-chair. They strongly suggest that you should <a target="_blank" rel="nofollow noreferrer noopener" href="http://www.maxitaxiperth.com.au/">book online</a>.
 There are numerous smaller companies that operate mainly out of the 
Central Business District. Fares are regulated by the state government 
and all dispatch companies charge the same rate. Flagfall is $3.90 
during weekdays, increasing to $5.70 on weeknights and weekends. The 
kilometre rate is $1.59/km charged in $0.10 increments. Surcharges apply
 on designated holiday periods (New Years Eve and Christmas Day) and on 
weekend nights between midnight and 5AM. Tipping taxi drivers in Perth 
is not customary, but adding a small gratuity ($1 or $2) on top of the 
fare is common for exceptional service.

</p><p>Catching a taxi from an <b>entertainment precinct</b> late on a 
Friday or Saturday night sees clubbers waiting at taxi stands up to 2 
hours for a ride home. Drivers are known to avoid picking up drunken 
patrons from outside of pubs, clubs or from the entrance to Perth 
station. There have been a recent spate of sexual assaults on female 
passengers so it is advisable to travel in groups. There are specially 
designated 'secure ranks' operating at these times where patrons can 
queue in (relative) safety. Another option is the late night Transperth 
trains and buses run specially for revellers after their night out.

</p><p>Services at <b>Perth Airport</b> are reliable and taxis arrive 
continually 24hrs a day. A typical taxi ride from the Domestic Airport 
to the City is around $30 ($35 from the International). There is a $2 
airport tax payable on top of the fare.

</p><p>Taxi service <b>Uber</b> is gaining popularity in Perth and 
offers a cheaper (up to 50%) and generally more reliable taxi service 
than the major taxi companies, but are limited in their locations. Users
 can sign up online using a mobile app and book a taxi from within the 
Perth CBD area to various locations, including the airport (~$22).

<p>Perth and Fremantle can be comfortably explored on foot or by bicycle
 as Perth has some of the best cycling and pedestrian infrastructure in 
Australia.  The Perth bicycle network features an ever growing, 
metro-wide system of bicycle/pedestrian paths.  The system features;

</p>
<ul><li> <b>Principal Shared Paths</b> (high standard shared paths that run adjacent to each railway lines and along major motorways).</li>
<li> <b>Local Bicycle Routes</b> (a series of on-road routes as well as 
some suburban off-road sections that run through parks -  these paths 
provide a connection to such destinations such as schools, shopping 
centres and other recreational facilities.</li>
<li> <b>Generic minor works</b> (projects include general improvements 
to the cycling environment in local areas, such as on-road bike lanes 
and sealed shoulders).</li>
<li> <b>End of trip facilities</b> (including; U-Rails, Cora bike racks and bike lockers and change-rooms).</li></ul>
<p>Cycle maps are available from most bike shops, and at Planners Map <a target="_blank" rel="nofollow noreferrer noopener" href="http://www.dpi.wa.gov.au/cycling/1924.asp">[23]</a>.
  The Department for Planning and Infrastructure provides a range of 
guides, maps and brochures for bike riders.  If you have a scenic route 
in mind, these brochures can take you to the coast, Kings Park, Armadale
 and the Hills or around the Swan River.

</p><p>A favourite amongst seasoned local cyclists is the ride along the
 North side of the Swan River between the City and Nedlands.  Allow 60 
min for a round trip along this route, as you might encounter a strong 
headwind.

</p><p>Bicycles are allowed on board Transperth trains but <b>not</b> during peak hour, unless they are the type of bicycle that can be folded up.

<h3><span id="By_car">By car</span><span><span>[</span><a href="https://wikitravel.org/wiki/en/index.php?title=Perth&amp;action=edit&amp;section=27" title="Edit section: By car">edit</a><span>]</span></span></h3>
<p>Renting a car is the ideal means of transportation for traveling to 
outlying attractions. Perth's major freeways and highways are free from 
any tolls, as is not the case in Sydney and Melbourne and from either of
 these major arterial roads, it is possible to be surrounded by 
beautiful countryside within minutes.

</p><p>Rent-a-car providers are located at the airport and there are quite a few scattered around the city and the suburbs.

</p><p>Perth is brimming with so much to see, you may want to take a 
limo which will offer a personalised tour which will take in the 
landmarks and coastal scenery, and this can be arranged through a limo 
hire company which specialises in these tours. You can also enjoy 
limousine wine tours, classic car hire, hummer tour in Perth city.

</p><p>The general speed limit within built-up areas is 50 km/h unless otherwise stated. 
 
</p><p>Note that traffic in Perth (as elsewhere in Australia) travels in
 the left-hand lane.  It is advisable to travel on the left hand lane 
even in dual carriageways for tourist drivers.  This might take a bit of
 getting used to if you drive on the right-hand side back home. Even for
 right-hand drivers some things are different here like the ability to 
overtake on the inside of a vehicle on a freeway.

</p><p>Note that Police are rarely seen out on the roads but manned 
mobile speed cameras operated by public servants are very prevalent.  
Driving even 5km/hr above the placarded speed can incur a fine. Driving 
 40km/hr above the placarded speed means the car is impounded for 28 
days even if it not your car (hire cars excepted).

<p>There is plenty to see in the city centre within wandering distance 
or on a free CAT bus. Hidden among the sprawl of the surrounding and 
metropolitan area are a few worthwhile attractions usually less than an 
hour away by car, or a bit longer on public transport.

</p><p>Outside of the metropolitan area are some unspoilt national parks, unpopulated coastline and other interesting locations.

</p>
<h3><span id="Kangaroos">Kangaroos</span><span><span>[</span><a href="https://wikitravel.org/wiki/en/index.php?title=Perth&amp;action=edit&amp;section=29" title="Edit section: Kangaroos">edit</a><span>]</span></span></h3>
<p>There is a designated area in the zoo for kangaroos where they can 
wander on visitors' paths and the animals are used to people so you can 
see them very close.

</p><p>To see semi-wild kangaroos visit the Pinnaroo Valley Memorial Park (a cemetery, but not European style) <a target="_blank" rel="nofollow noreferrer noopener" href="http://www.mcb.wa.gov.au/OurCemeteries/Pinnaroo.html">[24]</a>
 - it's a walking distance from Whitfords Transperth Train/Metro Station
 - just cross the highway, the highway exit and look for the entrance on
 the left. As there is plenty of space for them you may see them not 
only eating but also hopping.

</p><p>Many local golf clubs, Karrinyup Golf Club, Joondalup Golf Club 
will have Kangaroos dotted along the fairways, and it is very likely to 
spot them during a game of golf.

<ul><li> <span id="Swim"><span>Swim</span>. <span>Perth boasts some of 
the country's best beaches, which are ideal for swimming during the 
warmer months.  Sunscreen is essential and insect repellent may come in 
handy during the evening.  As the beaches are on the open ocean it is 
strongly advised that you only 'swim between the flags' at patrolled 
beaches.  Probably the easiest beach to get to by public transport is 
Scarborough beach, which can be accessed by catching the Joondalup line 
from platform 1 at either Perth Underground or Esplanade stations, 
getting off at Glendalough station and catching the 990 bus. Cottesloe 
Beach, one of Perth's most famous, and a favourite among locals and 
tourists alike, it even easier to access by public transport. Take the 
Fremantle line to Cottesloe Station, exit the platform at the Perth end,
 and head west down Forrest Street for about 10 min. Or you can take bus
 102 from Williams street or Esplanade station and it has a stop right 
by the Cottesloe beach.  There is a shady grassed area as well as sand, 
and the beach is patrolled.</span> &nbsp;<a href="#Swim" title="click to edit Swim" rel="nofollow">edit</a></span></li></ul>
<ul><li> <span id="Swim_Naked"><span>Swim Naked</span>. <span>There is 
only one beach in Perth that permits nude bathing: Swanbourne. Males 
sunbathing topless at other beaches is the norm, however females will 
not usually get a police fine but will get stared at. The atmosphere at 
Swanbourne Clothing Optional Beach (about 500 m north of Swanbourne 
Beach) is friendly and relaxing. It is more of a sunbathing beach than a
 swimming beach, with a steep sandy descent into water which gets deep 
quickly. There are no lifeguards or red-and-yellow flags at this beach 
and so it is essential to keep a close eye on children near the water. 
The nude beach is frequented by a variety of sun-seekers of all ages; 
couples, families, groups. The easiest way to get there is by car, 
however there is a train station about 1km away.  Alternatively, you can
 catch the bus 102, which is heading to Cottesloe.  The bus will go 
through some residential area before reaching Cottesloe coast.  As soon 
as you can see the ocean, get off the bus and Swanbourne beach is right 
cross the road.  Heading north down the beach, you can reach the nude 
beach.</span> &nbsp;<a href="#Swim_Naked" title="click to edit Swim Naked" rel="nofollow">edit</a></span></li></ul>
<ul><li> <span id="Cycle"><span>Cycle</span>. <span>Perth has excellent 
bike paths and fantastic weather almost all year round which makes it

 one of the bike hire providers located near the Swan River or take a 
tour with Bluetongue Bike Tours <a target="_blank" rel="nofollow noreferrer noopener" href="http://www.perthbiketours.com.au/">[1]</a> or Pedal OZ <a target="_blank" rel="nofollow noreferrer noopener" href="http://www.pedaloz.com.au/">[2]</a>.</span> &nbsp;<a href="#Cycle" title="click to edit Cycle" rel="nofollow">edit</a></span> </li></ul>

 As with any travelling in a country with as low a density as Perth, you
 will become accustomed to spending a lot of time travelling between the
 sights.  One of the best day trips in Perth is to visit the nature 
reserve off the coast of Fremantle, Rottnest Island.  You can access 
Rottnest Island by a ferry, 30 min from Fremantle or a longer from 
Barrack Street Jetty in Perth.  The trip can be expensive, but Rottnest 
Express has a “Telethon Tuesday” deal with half price tickets ($35 
instead of $70) every week for most of the year.  Rottnest is a car free
 island, but plenty of bikes available for hire from the island or 
directly from the ferry company.  There is a huge variety of wildlife to
 see (including the famous Quokka) and opportunities to see whales, 
dolphins and fur seals off the coast, but this will always depend on the
 season.  Another (closer, cheaper but smaller) option is to visit 
Penguin Island, home of the "Little Penguins" or "Fairy Penguins", 
located 5 min off the coast of Rockingham, a 45 min drive south of 
Perth.</span> &nbsp;<a href="#Take_a_Day_Trip" title="click to edit Take a Day Trip" rel="nofollow">edit</a></span></li></ul>
<ul><li> <span id="Go_Wine_Tasting"><span>Go Wine Tasting</span>. <span>Well renowned amongst locals and tourists alike, the <b>Swan Valley</b> in <a href="https://wikitravel.org/en/Perth/The_Hills" title="Perth/The Hills">the hills</a>
 boasts some of the country's best wineries and micro-breweries. 
Although the wine is perhaps not as highly regarded by seasoned wine 
buffs as that produced in regions such as Margaret River, the Swan 
Valley features the advantage of being close to the city.</span> &nbsp;<a href="#Go_Wine_Tasting" title="click to edit Go Wine Tasting" rel="nofollow">edit</a></span></li></ul>
<p>There are a lot of options if you have access to a car - from the 
city just head to the coast, then head north or south for some 
exploring.

</p>
<ul><li> <span id="Adventure_World"><span>Adventure World</span>, <a href="http://www.adventureworld.net.au/" rel="nofollow">[4]</a>. <span>Perth's
 only theme park has roller coasters, water slides, go-karts, and rides 
for younger kids. Located in Bibra Lake, it's around 20 minutes by car 
from the CBD with plenty of parking available so it's best to go by car.
 It can be reached from Fremantle within 20 minutes by taking the number
 520 bus which departs every 30 - 60 minutes. The park is usually open 
from September through to June but check the website for open times and

<p>Previously thought by some to be lacklustre, shopping options in 
Perth have improved dramatically in recent years, with major 
international luxury brands such as Burberry, Gucci and Louis Vuitton 
now having branches in Perth, along with many local Western Australian 
boutiques. As a general rule, the luxury brands are located around the 
junction King's Street and Hay Street in the city centre, while 
mid-range options are generally to be found at the pedestrian-only Hay 
Street and Murray Street malls.

</p><p>The largest concentration of boutique shops is in the City centre while adjacent <b>Northbridge</b> is the place for niche independent stores. Trendier suburbs such as <b>Mount Lawley</b>, <b>Leederville</b> and <b>Subiaco</b> have a number of offbeat designer fashion stores.  
  
</p><p>Large shopping complexes located in the outer suburbs, such as in <b>Morley</b>, <b>Carousel, Cannington</b>, <b>Midland</b>, <b>Joondalup</b>, <b>Booragoon (Garden City)</b>, <b>Innaloo</b> and <b>Karrinyup</b> have the usual department and chain stores.

<p>One of Perth's drawbacks is that its people have not embraced <b>late night dining</b>. Very few places will serve food after 10PM, even on Friday or Saturday nights. While most restaurants in Perth do cater for <b>vegetarians</b> (and more rarely <b>vegans</b>),
 the selection is often decidedly limited. If you are looking for a 
place that embraces vegetarian food, Fremantle is probably a better 
option.

<p>There is an extensive array of restaurants in <b>Northbridge</b>. You
 will find a great selection of Southern European and Asian restaurants.
 Northbridge gets very busy on Friday and Saturday nights as Perth goes 
into party mode. Neighbouring <b>Mount Lawley and Highgate</b> also has some good options. <b>Victoria Park</b>
 has a stretch of restaurants along Albany Hwy which is a fairly steady 
location with the locals and has a few high quality restaurants, 
although is lower key and more casual. 
 
</p><p><a href="https://wikitravel.org/en/Perth/Fremantle" title="Perth/Fremantle">Fremantle</a> is a good eating option. Famous for its <b>cappuccino strip</b> lined with cafes next door to one another popular with the yuppie crowd. On weekends, a local tradition is to visit the <b>Fisherman's Wharf</b> on warm, sunny weekend evenings for <b>fish and chips</b>.
 There are a couple of options to choose from close to the beach. Just 
follow your nose or the seagulls. Further exploring in Fremantle, or 
"Freo" as it is locally known, can reveal lots of trendy, alternative 
restaurants that cater for the "careful" eaters. If you care about 
knowing what it is you are eating, (vegan, preservative free, fair 
trade, organic), try exploring the Freo markets area, or just ask 
around, they are often not in the "touristy areas".  <b>Little Creatures</b>
 is a decent brewery.
If you are looking for a decent fish and chip or seafood dinner, it is 
typically far more expensive by the coast (where the tourists are), 
excellent seafood at a better price can be sourced in the central and 
eastern suburbs.

</p><p><b>Subiaco</b> is located just a couple of kilometres from the 
city center. It is a trendy but fun suburb which features some great 
food and entertainment, although it can be quite expensive.

</p><p><b>Claremont</b> is a suburb on the Fremantle railway line where 
you will find some good restaurants as well (including authentic 
Italian), although, again, it can quite expensive and there is a limited
 range.

</p><p>The <b>Swan Valley</b>, especially along West Swan Road contains 
various wineries, food producers and restaurants with stunning views 
over the vineyards.  Particularly good are <b>The Black Swan Cafe</b>, <b>Duckstein Brewery</b>, <b>Elmar's</b> and <b>The Mallard Duck Cafe</b>.

</p><p><b>Kalamunda</b> and other Eastern hills suburbs offer hidden 
gems of cafes, small shops and food producers in beautiful countryside 
with stunning city views. Traditionally Perth locals used to go for 
picnics and produce festivals in these areas back in the 19th and early 
20th century, however as the practice waned with fashions leading 
towards the coast, it is an excellent place to visit away from the 
touristy areas for a relaxing or peaceful trip to the bush with fine 
views and decent food not too far from the city. People often do DIY 
food tours to local orchards, vineyards, cheesemakers, bakeries and 
other cottage industries, arts and cafes as its not really organised. 
Its usually best to visit during Spring or soon after the rains when the
 forest is at its best.

</p><p><b>Guildford</b> has many antique stores (although like all 
Australian antique markets are visited by many hundreds of tourists as 
well as locals, so real bargains can be rare), but you can get decent 
cafe morning teas and lunches in some fine old architecture. This area 
has some of Perths oldest residential houses and grand building museums 
&amp; cafes. The old theatre now houses a large Asian textile and 
artworks store worth a visit and a quirky taxidermy museum a few doors 
down. Alfreds Kitchen is a tiny but legendary burger bar to the locals, 
who amass in large crowds that opens at night.

<p>A large <b>Western Rock Lobster</b> (known locally by its former name of <i>crayfish</i>)
 industry. Most of the crayfish is exported to Asia and USA for vast 
sums of money. However, crayfish prices in Perth can be relatively 
cheap, especially during summer in a good season. A chance to give it a 
try without breaking the bank.

</p><p><b>Chilli Mussels</b> are a popular local speciality, consisting of mussels cooked in tomato and chilli jus, available in various restaurants. 
 
</p><p>Truffles are grown around Mundaring and Manjimup.

</p><p>The ubiquitous fast food chains serve the usual oily stuff.

</p><p>If you're interested in a gourmet road trip, nearby Margaret 
River (about three hours drive away) is extremely popular for wine 
tasting, delicious chocolate and fresh, locally made food and produce. 
The <b>Spring in the Valley</b> Food &amp; Wine Festival in the Swan 
Valley is increasingly popular, but at the cost of getting a place 
cheaply and it being overcrowded. Its best to visit the Swan Valley 
outside of the festival to get the best value, or during the festival if
 you like the crowds. Most of these places have websites that you can 
confirm times and dates and are open throughout the year.

<p>Perth has an a number substandard <b>Gloria Jeans</b>, <b>Miss Mauds</b> and <b>Dome</b>
 stores mainly in the city centre and suburban shopping areas. A larger 
number of of independent cafes serving high quality coffee (of various 
types and brews) line the trendy streets of suburbs around the city 
centre. One of the most well known place for a espresso is the <i>Cafe Strip</i>
 in Fremantle closely, however, a higher standard can generally be found
 in Perth, Mt Lawley, Leederville, South Perth and other inner-city 
suburbs. Although Perth culture has a high quality taste for coffee and 
demands very high standards in product, Perth has some of the more 
expensive coffee prices in the country with a normal sized coffee (e.g. 
latte) coming close to $4.

<p>Perth has bars scattered throughout the city but most bars are in the
 CBD, Northbridge, Subiaco, Leederville, Victoria Park, Mount Lawley 
&amp; Fremantle areas. Bars usually become busy after 5pm with the 
afterwork crowd, but most locals tend to go to bars on Friday &amp; 
Saturday nights. The CBD bars in particular get very busy on Friday 
nights with many of the popular bars forming long entry lines. Most bars
 open from around 11AM and close midnight, although most bars in 
Northbridge and around the city centre stay open until 1 or 2am, and 
many bars in other areas have special extended liquor trading hours to 
either 1, 2 or 3AM. There has been an increase in small bars and bistro 
dining in niche areas of the CBD, however these are typically expensive 
even though good quality, so shop around for a good value evening. 
Smoking is prohibited inside all pubs and bars.

<p>Club nights and both international and local gigs are held at a 
variety of venues across the city centre, Northbridge, Subiaco and 
Leederville, with some clubs scattered further out. Club nights are 
popular or Wednesdays, Fridays and Saturdays with few venues opening

<p>An unfortunate effect of the current mining boom is that the price of
 accommodation in Perth has skyrocketed in recent years, with average 
room rates currently higher than those in Sydney, Melbourne or even 
Rome. Figure on paying over $100 per night for even the most basic room,
 and over $200 for a 4-star hotel. In general, room rates tend to be 
most expensive in mid-week, when many business travellers visit, while 
(relative) bargains can often be found on the weekends.

<p>Most of Perth's hotels are concentrated in the <a href="https://wikitravel.org/en/Perth/City" title="Perth/City">city centre</a>, the neighbouring suburb of <a href="https://wikitravel.org/wiki/en/index.php?title=East_Perth&amp;action=edit&amp;redlink=1" title="East Perth (page does not exist)">East Perth</a>, as well as the seaside suburb of <a href="https://wikitravel.org/en/Fremantle" title="Freemantle">Fremantle</a>.

<p>Perth is very popular with backpackers and there are a large number 
of backpackers' hostels located in the city, particularly in the 
Northbridge area. Be warned there are a few hostels in Perth that are in

<p>If you plan to stay for a longer period than one month in Perth you 
might consider renting an apartment or share room. You can find these 
accommodations online, for example on Gumtree. Prices range from $120 to

<p>Caravan parks are a cost effective and often good value family way to
 stay in Perth. Caravan parks are usually some distance from the city, 
but some have bus stops right out the front door. Caravan parks are 
generally clean and offer a variety of accommodation types.

<p>The main dangers that an overseas visitor to Perth faces are <b>sunburn</b>
 and dehydration.  Make sure you cover yourself with SPF 30+ sunscreen 
and a hat, and preferably a shirt and always keep a bottle of water with
 you (preferably a litre), especially in the warmer months. Also be wary
 of dehydration in the hot weather. An insect repellent such as 
'Aeroguard' will be useful on summer evenings if you are outdoors. 
 
</p><p>Otherwise, Perth is relatively safe, though its best not to walk 
alone at night. Some areas such as Northbridge are also known to be 
'trouble spots' on weekend nights and tourist should be careful. Perth 
citizens (as with most Australians) almost never carry firearms or other
 weaponry, therefore it is logical to avoid people and places whenever 
such things are observed and advise the local police service when safe 
to do so. Overall Perth is becoming safer, due to small alleyways and 
other niche problem zones being refurbished and unsuitable for 
loiterers.

</p><p>Police are generally friendly and approachable. To contact the emergency services, call <b>000</b>.  For general enquiries and for police assistance when the matter is not urgent, ring <b>131 444</b> (international: +61 8 9222 1111).

</p><p>Trains are generally safe, and Transit Officers patrol <i>all</i>
 train services after 19:00, and also do so routinely throughout the 
day. All railway stations are fitted with an emergency call facility, 
usually accompanied by the ticket vending machines (<i>note that the emergency call facility will connect to the Railway Police, and not the Western Australia Police Service</i>).
 All stations have cameras constantly monitored by the Railway Police. 
In each carriage of every train, there is a call button near the either 
of the doors which allows a passenger to communicate with the train 
driver in an emergency. If it is not safe to use one of these buttons 
due to their position, any passenger may walk to the next carriage and 
use the call button there, or ring <b>9220 9999</b>.

</p><p>From 2011, the Armadale/Thornlie Train line especially in the 
areas of Burswood and Carlisle has had some high profile assaults from 
gangs travelling on the train system. The gangs usually comprise of 
disaffected Indigenous youth and although weapons are not usually 
involved attacks have become more vicious in their nature.

</p><p>The bus network is generally safe, but after hours can be a 
little more dangerous than the train network. It is not patrolled by the
 Railway Police, and bus security patrols are limited. Reports of 
attacks by people throwing rocks at buses and general antisocial 
behaviour is not unheard of. The only particular station (&amp; its 
associated routes) that should be avoided is Mirrabooka. If you have to 
travel by bus at night, towards the front of the bus. If an incident on 
the bus occurs, <i>tell the driver</i>. Incidents — including violent 
attacks — carry on for far too long as they are not reported. The driver
 should then radio for assistance and will be met by bus security.

</p><p>Pedestrians are advised to exercise caution when crossing the 
road at zebra crossings, walking along the footpath at the entry/exit 
points of car parks and driveways, or when crossing the road at 
T-intersections. Although pedestrians have the legal right of way in all
 of these situations, many motorists fail to observe this rule. This is 
usually due to ignorance or inattention rather than vindictiveness, but 
in any case it is obviously not worth risking life and limb in order to 
assert your rights as a pedestrian. In the case of zebra crossings, 
motorists should slow down if they see you are about to cross. If they 
do not slow down, do not begin to cross. It is usually best to follow 
the lead of the locals and to move as a group.

</p><p>Driving in Perth can be straightforward as its highways tend to 
connect at various nodes making navigation easy. However, avoid 
travelling during business rush hour (between 7-9AM and 4-6PM), 
particularly in summer or hot days. Many of Perth's major roads were not
 designed for the volume of traffic currently experienced with recent 
high population growth. Perth drivers are increasingly known for being 
inconsiderate to other drivers on the roads during these times, which 
also has caused increased delays due to accidents. 
 
</p><p>The much wiser solution is to take public transport such as the 
train or bus system. If you are driving or a passenger in a taxi or a 
local residents car, it is recommended to relax and not allow it to 
affect you or your holiday. Most Perth citizens work long hours and wish
 to get home quickly away from the heat and traffic so therefore their 
behaviour is not personal and while is often aggressive, is seldom 
reckless. Travelling outside of these hours and on weekends is typically
 low hassles. It is likely these problems will increase over the next 
few years from 2012, as major roads are being upgraded and/or expanded 
to cope with increased volumes with new infrastructure projects, 
especially around the Perth Airport district.

</p><p>There are a few rules to take care of while during driving in 
Western Australia. When stopped at a train crossing, do not proceed 
until the flashing lights have stopped even if the boom gate has fully 
lifted as fines are issued. There is a lower tolerance towards speeding 
so even a small excess over the road limit may warrant in an 
infringement or fine. It is not mandatory or always observed, however it
 is polite to keep a gap at an unmarked road crossing when stuck in 
traffic to allow access for turning vehicles. If you have noticed the 
lane next to you leave a gap in these places, it is polite do the same. 
It is always wise to take great care during merging traffic lanes, 
especially during rush hour (as per above paragraph). Buses do have 
right of way when entering traffic and occasionally often pull out with 
little warning.
Australians are allowed to overtake on the inside lane, so drivers 
should be aware of this to avoid any potential alarm. If you are given 
right of way by another car, it is highly considered rude <i>not to</i> acknowledge this with a raised hand or brief wave.

</p><p>Be wary of using ATMs, fraudulent devices have been added to some
 across Perth, but the prevalence is no higher than in any major city. 
ATMs are available outside nearly every bank branch. Recently ATM 
bombings have been reported more frequently compared to other Australian
 cities. The most notable incident is the bombing of 4 ATMs at the 
Harbour Town Shopping complex in West Perth in January 2013. There was 
no injury as it occurred when the centre was closed, but it did cause 
severe structural damage to the building. Be wary of using ATMs in 
secluded places at night or during the early hours of the morning.
